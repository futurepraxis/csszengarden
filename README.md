# csszengarden
CSS Zen Garden was completed as an exercise for HCI 406: Web Design at DePaul University. The assignment was to continue in the tradition of [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/), a web-development resource that showcases the design possibilities of CSS. For this assignment, we were provided an HTML file and given the challenge of creating a brand-new layout using only CSS, without changing the original HTML.
